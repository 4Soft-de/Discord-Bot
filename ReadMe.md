# 4Soft Discord Bot

In our company, we are doing monthly [Coding Dojos](https://codingdojo.org/).
Our current project is the creation of an own Discord Bot as a fun project.

## How to use

This project is meant to be a group work so the token won't be public (it couldn't even be if we want it).
Also we don't think that Pull Requests are really for the purpose of a group project like that.

This project is intended to have guests so you can get in contact with us if you want to take part in it.

Please note:
- We are a German company so you should be able to speak German.
- We don't have any future plans about the bot yet, we also don't know if and when we have our next meeting.

### For group members

Create a `config.properties` **on root level** and provide
the token we give you in the format `token=<here token>`.
